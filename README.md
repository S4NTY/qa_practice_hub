# 🐞 QA Practice Hub

**End-to-End Test Automation Framework** for the [QA Practice Hub](https://qapracticehub.com) — built with BDD, Playwright & pytest, powered by Allure reports.

---

## 📖 About

**QA Practice Hub** is an automated end-to-end testing project that turns manual QA workflows into executable specs.

The framework combines **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** with **Playwright UI automation** and the **pytest** ecosystem to deliver fast, readable, and reliable E2E tests for the web forms of the practice application.

Every scenario is written in **Gherkin** (`.feature` files), mapped to **step definitions**, implemented against **Page Object** models, and executed with **Playwright** as the browser automation engine — with rich reporting via **Allure**.
